New to EV Charging. Someone please explain,"I created a free account with ChargePoint as they have some right next to my job.

Charging speed is 6.6 kW, is that an hour? If I needed to charge 40kWh of my 81kWh battery (Model Y), would it just take 5 hours? 

For cost, it estimate $7.26/2 hrs, or $3.63/1 hr. That sounds very expensive, is it? How accurate are these estimates? 

It also says the energy rate is $0.55/kWh. So am I paying that rate or the hourly rate? I am probably doing my math wrong, but I don’t think those rates are the same. I think the 0.55/kWh is more expensive over the $3.63/hr. 

At my apartment complex I have EVGateway charging at $.35/kWh (when there isn’t a gas car taking up the space 95% of the time)

Is EV battery charging going to get much faster?,"I got an EV last year and I've loved it.  It seems to me the only draw back is the charging time.  I periodically have to drive ~500 miles in a day.  That's 8-9 hours with two or three ~5 min stops in my old ICE vehicle.

I just did it in the EV and stopping to charge when it told me to...  It took 11 hours with 3 ~40 minute stops.

Now I'll say this, I kinda didn't mind em, I watched a TV show stretched my legs, got a bite to eat.  But if I was in a rush, that's a lot slower.

I'm wondering if there seems to be much room for innovation on battery charging, new techniques? more power? different chemistry?  Or are we kind of looking at boundaries in physics?

Mostly I'm asking cause my new phone seems to charge maybe 3x faster than my old one... are there similarly big leaps coming in automotives?",smoochface,1720554207.0,31,AskEngineers

I found a free EV charger and it almost feels criminal lol,"I just got my Bolt 2 weeks ago and I’m still getting used to the charging situation.

I went to an evGo station at it cost $11 to charge 25% which I though was kind of crazy (I’m in California so it was 57cents/kw).

Anyway today I really needed a fast charge and I pull up to the station and there is a Tesla there. And even though there’s 2 plugs, apparently only one can be used at a time.

So I hopped on Google to find other charging stations and saw that the AAA across the street had 2 free ones. I didn’t believe it at first, but I pulled up and low and behold it really is free!

Ain’t no way I’m even charging at home anymore lol.",ComprehensiveSnow966,1653331073.0,33,BoltEV
